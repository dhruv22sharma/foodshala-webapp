        FoodShala works by acting as a bridge between customers and restaurants. It utilizes an innovative technology platform that allows customers to order food from nearby restaurants and get it delivered at their doorstep. With FoodShala, customers do not have to keep the contact numbers of various restaurants and eateries in their locality. FoodShala works as a single point of contact for ordering food from all restaurants that may be there at a particular location. FoodShala has its own team of delivery professionals who pickup orders from restaurants and deliver it at the customer's doorstep. This has made the task of ordering food a lot easier for customers. Restaurants also gain by getting more orders and avoiding costs and efforts associated with maintaining their own delivery personnel.
